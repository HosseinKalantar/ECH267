# ECH267
Course Project

Overview:
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook files for the ECH267 course project.

EMPC.ipynb: This notebook implements the closed-loop economic model predictive control (EMPC) for the described multi-functional heat pump (MFHP) as detailed in the report.
RBC.ipynb: This notebook implements the Rule-Based Controller (RBC) for the MFHP.

Usage:
Both Jupyter Notebooks require two CSV files as input data. These files are provided and should be attached in the same directory as the notebooks.

Input Data Files:
Amb_temp_and_hot_water_draw_mass_flow_rate.csv
Time_varying_elec_rates.csv

Instructions:
Ensure Jupyter Notebook is installed in your environment.
Open EMPC.ipynb or RBC.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook.
Execute the cells in sequence to run the simulation and view the results.

Note:
Make sure to review the report for a comprehensive understanding of the MFHP and the control strategies implemented in these notebooks.
